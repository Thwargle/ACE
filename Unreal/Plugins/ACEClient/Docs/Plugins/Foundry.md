# Dereth Foundry

A bundled, disabled-by-default Lua content workshop inspired by
[AceCreator](https://github.com/harliq/AceCreator). Enable **Dereth Foundry** in
Plugin Manager and open its gold anvil / teal cube icon. The interface uses the
shared retail-font plugin styling, centered buttons, consistent padding and
per-character settings.

## Workflows

- **Items:** enter a WCID/classname or copy the current selection. Create a live
  object in the world/inventory or a persistent instance; inspect, import/export,
  remove an instance or delete the selected live object.
- **Move:** nudge the selected instance in eight compass directions, vertically,
  or to your location. Rotate to an explicit heading or your direction. ACE uses
  0 degrees north and 90 degrees west.
- **Land:** use the current hexadecimal landblock ID, import/export JSON/SQL,
  reload the landblock, print your location or clear the server cache.
- **Quests:** import/export quest names and recipe IDs in JSON/SQL.
- **Spawns:** create a generator instance from its WCID, capture a parent GUID,
  link a child instance, or add/remove an encounter.
- **Files:** choose a local ACE content folder, filter and page through JSON/SQL
  files, select a file to fill the matching tab's ID, or open it in a text editor.
- **Help:** the creation workflow, access requirements and recent request results.

For an initial edit, export an existing object, open the exported file in Files,
edit/save it, import its ID, then create a preview. Create a persistent instance
when ready, position it, and export the landblock. Persistent edits, imports and
deletes have an inline review step; changing selection cancels a pending targeted
edit. Commands are queued individually with a one-second minimum interval.

## Local files and server permissions

Foundry uses ACE's existing commands; it does not grant privileges, embed Decal,
load arbitrary DLLs, connect to a database or execute SQL locally. The server
must authorize each developer/admin command. A sent-command result is not proof
that ACE accepted it: check chat for the server response.

The workshop displays slash commands, while the native content service sends
ACE's `@` command prefix in the Talk packet (for example `/ci 123` becomes
`@ci 123`). `ACE.Plugins.Foundry` exercises both creation buttons through Lua,
the public service dispatcher and the outgoing packet, in addition to checking
permissions and target validation.

The local content folder contains `json/weenies`, `sql/weenies` and equivalent
`landblocks`, `quests` and `recipes` directories. Windows offers a native folder
picker and opens files in Notepad. Other platforms use `ClientMods/Content` and
the platform file manager/editor where available. Imports read the **server's**
`content_folder`; for a remote server, copy the edited file there separately.
**Show server content folder** requests that setting through ACE.

## Lua integration and runtime cost

`foundry/main.lua` owns the tabs, validation, review, per-character fields and
bounded request queue. `admin_content` supplies only the native command and file
services documented in [PublicAPI.md](PublicAPI.md). The plugin requests only
selection and position at one-second intervals, scans files on demand, pages 128
results at a time, and retains only eight recent status messages. Opening it does
not create objects, change the server, scan directories or request inventory.
